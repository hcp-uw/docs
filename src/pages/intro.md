## The Problems We Aim To Solve

Getting software development internships is extremely difficult, especially for non-CS majors. Unfortunately, the best way to improve your odds for an internship is to have a prior internship. This circular logic of needing experience to get experience is extremely frustrating, and discourages hundreds of non-CS majors from pursuing software development.

While the obvious solution is to provide more projects through CS coursework for non-CS majors,, the majority of these projects are completed solo or in pairs. As a result, students are missing out on working in larger teams, which is more common in industry. In addition, the non-majors CS coursework do not teach the proper design workflow that SDEs in tech follow, which is an crucial skill that aspiring SDEs should practice before entering the workforce.

## Our Solution

We aim to break the never-ending circular logic of needing experience to get experience that plagues new programmers that are trying to be qualified for jobs or internships.

We do so by organizing members into teams that develop large-scale programming projects that simulate an internship-like environment through our club. As a result, our members can acquire the experiences they need to succeed in their future endeavors as a team.

In addition, we foster a judgement-free, safe, and educational environment that prioritizes the learning experience over the stress of grades and school. We accept all members regardless of major or experience level in software development in addition to other protected categories.

## What We Do

- We help our members form into programming project teams that will be working throughout the school year (and maybe over summer)
- Members will be supported through a professional design and development process that is used in the tech industry
- At the end of their project, teams will present their work to the club and potentially to recruiters and SDEs at our annual HCP Showcase event.
- We will assist and support the growth & development of project teams throughout the school year to help members gain technical experience.
