# Purpose & Role Qualifications!

## Purpose of Education Lead

The purpose of the Education Lead is to familiarize members with common tools and fundamental skills used in industry. Education Leads prepare and manage future educational events, like technical interviews, hackathons, and more.

## Role Qualifications

### Hard Skills
Leads need to be quick learners and have the ability to quickly learn and be able to teach new topics that they may or may not have known of, as they will be delivering the content to a large number of audiences and/or guiding members through their technical challenges. Creating slideshows and delivering the presentations/workshops are essential skills as well, since the workshops are meant to be educational and should be understandable to people of any skill level.

- Create slideshows
- Quick & avid learner
- Ability to learn and teach new topics
- Deliver the presentation/workshop

### Soft Skills

Prior knowledge of the topic is not required, however the lead needs to be willing to learn the topic individually to sufficiently teach in front of 20-30 people. Public speaking skills are valuable in this case. Maintaining communication within a team, and contributing ideas brainstorming/presentation content are all valuable to consistent workshop planning.

### Time Commitment

The time commitment for the education team lead varies between weeks, and generally more time and effort is needed near the workshop, though it is optimal to plan ahead and spread tasks out. On average, the time commitment is 3-4 hours per week with the following breakdown:

- [1.5+ hrs] General Meeting && sync up with other team members
- [1 hr] education team meeting on workshop planning (not weekly).
- [1.5+ hrs] individual workshop preparation/dry run/workshop presentation

The education team as a whole decides to host **at least 1 workshop per quarter**, as the other event is usually allotted to a social one. 2 workshops per quarter have only been done with guest speakers or a presenter that takes the responsibility of most of the presenting content, which can be expected in fall with sufficient summer preparation.. Each lead can, upon communicating with the rest of the team, decide how much time they can dedicate to each workshop as long as they meet the requirements of 3-4 hours per week on average.
