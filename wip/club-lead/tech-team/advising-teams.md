# Advising Teams [S][R]

***Quick Terminology***
- [S] indicates that a task is "shared" means every Tech lead is responsible for this task
- [R] indicates that a task is "required" means there must be at least one Tech lead on the task

## What?
Tech leads are in charge of advising teams if they ask for any software-related help. This includes:
- A team needs help deciding which software stack to use
    - To answer these sorts of questions, suggest a couple routes a team can go down and allow the team to choose for themselves.
    - Some examples include choosing a hosting platform, choosing a framework for frontend work, choosing a graphics engine for game development, choosing microprocessors for embedded work, choosing a database for data storage, etc.
- A team needs help learning how to learn a specific software
    - To answer these questions, first gauge how long the software will take them to learn. If the software will only take <~20 mins to learn (i.e git), then collaborate with the education team to give them a quick impromptu workshop if time permits. In general however, provide them with a list of resources varying in medium and density while ensuring that the team has the prerequisites to understand those resources.
    - Some examples include resources for learning React, resources for learning SQL, resources for learning how to use Unity, resources for creating a simple starter project, etc.
- A team needs help understanding a certain abstract concept
    - To answer these questions, try your best to simplify the concept down and make sure to pause for questions. Remember, if you do not have enough experience in the area of question, feel free to either call upon the help of another tech team member or say "I don't know but I will do a bit of research and get back to you".
    - Some examples include learning what a backend is and when to use it, learning how to think about a webserver, etc.

## How?
For in-person advising, this will be done during the general meetings where the tech team will be floating around asking teams if they have any questions about specific softwares. If a tech lead is not floating around, they will make themselves available at a specific location in the meeting room (i.e. at a specific table) so that PM's are able to easily call them over.

For asynchronous advising, teams will ping the tech leads when they need help in the discord, so "interrupt driven" help will be followed.
