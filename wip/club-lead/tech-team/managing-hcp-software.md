# Managing HCP Software [N][R][O]

***Quick Terminology***
- [N] indicates that a task is "not-shared" means that not every Tech lead must do this task
- [R] indicates that a task is "required" means there must be at least one Tech lead on the task
- [O] indicates that a task is "optional" means that the task is recommended, but not required

## Github [N][R]
Tech leads should manage the services provided by Github as well as ensure that every member of every team is able to access their teams repository.

Tasks in this area might include:
- Create repositories for new project teams and set up the required permissions and rules for that repository.
- Research and add third-party features to the Github to increase productivity.
- Research and implement automation pipelines for common tasks like adding people to the Github, etc.

## Discord [N][R]
Tech leads should manage the services provided by Discord as well as ensuring members have access to their team's channels.

Tasks in this area might include:
- Debugging any issues that members may be facing relating to Discord like access, etc.
- Research and implement automation pipelines for common tasks like adding people to the discord, etc.

## Shared Drive [N][O]
Tech leads should manage the shared drive and ensure that members are able to access shared documents.

Tasks in this area might include:
- Ensuring that only active members have access to the drive and folders within the drive
- Managing clutter and making sure that the documents are easy to find
- Migrating to other drive technologies if required (OneDrive?)

## Cloud Technologies [N][R]
FUTURE: Since we plan on having a formalized process (with a specific cloud provider) for hosting applications, a Tech lead must be in-charge of managing this process and technology.

Tasks in this area might include:
- Managing team access to various cloud services from both a financial and security perspective.
- Setting up "templates" for using specific technologies within the cloud (to make it easier for teams to use cloud services)
- Provisioning resources to various teams as needed

Note that this section will be greatly expanded as we formalize hosting processes.
