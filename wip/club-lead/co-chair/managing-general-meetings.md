# Managing General Meetings

## Quarterly schedule
Co-chairs should create and update Quarterly Schedules for the club. This ensures that members know our future plans, including any upcoming events, workshops, general meetings, etc. Along with that, club leads are aware of what events they have promised to host for the club, thereby motivating them to prepare for these events. Any updates/changes/revisions to the quarterly schedule that concerns club leadership must be approved by them, especially if it involves changing event datetimes or event content. It is important to maintain complete transparency of club events to our members and club leadership.

## Meeting Slides & Meeting Content
Meeting slides should be made for every general meeting. It is the Co-chairâ€™s responsibility to decide what is on those slides, what content to cover, topics to discuss, and opportunities to shout out. The task may be slightly delegated to other lead teams, but only in the form of getting feedback. Reminders should be sent out in the Discord prior to each meeting, and slides should be posted in the #meeting-reminders channel once the meeting starts.

## Ensuring General Meeting Logistics
As a large and growing club, we need to ensure that the logistics of general meetings are pitch-perfect. This means ensuring that a club meeting space is reserved for the year and testing out all necessary technologies within that space (especially for presenting slides). General meetings should maintain at least a 99% rate of not having any technical difficulties (what this means is, do your best to ensure that general meetings run smoothly). There should never be a time when general meetings are canceled, delayed, or severely disrupted due to technical difficulties, failure to secure a large enough room, or any other logistical reason.
