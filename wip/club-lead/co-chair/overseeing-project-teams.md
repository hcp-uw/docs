# Overseeing Project Teams

## Assigning Club Lead PMs for Teams
Each team in the club is required to have some sort of project manager. For a new team, that role is temporarily filled by a club lead PM. First, Co-Chairs are responsible for gauging club lead interest in being a PM. Then, Co-Chairs are responsible for matching project teams to club lead PMs such that the difficulty of the project aligns with the club lead’s experience and skill level. Co-Chairs are not strictly required to, but highly recommended to PM for some project teams.

## Providing High-Level Guidance on Project Team Timeline
While the timeline of projects is typically arbitrary depending on the progress that teams make, Co-chairs are responsible for setting high-level deadlines for projects (such as deadlines for the pitch, spec presentation, etc). Based on these deadlines, Co-chairs are expected to provide high-level guidance to teams on their project timeline, what they should be working on, and what they should have completed. This task can (and should) be delegated to club-lead PMs for the projects that they manage. However, the overall process is provided by the Co-chairs and agreed upon with other club lead PMs.

## Facilitating Pitch, Spec, and Showcase Presentations
Events such as the pitch, spec, and showcase presentations should be facilitated by Co-chairs similar to how general meetings are facilitated. The difference in these events is that it needs to be more structured, ideally with an agenda and limitations to the time given to each team for their presentation. Co-chairs are largely responsible for facilitating the event and making sure it’s successful (which can be measured based on event quality, attendee feedback, and internal retrospectives).

## Getting and Providing Updates on Project Teams
Since Co-chairs are responsible for providing high-level guidance to teams on their timeline, they should also be responsible for getting updates on project teams through each club lead PM, and sharing the updates within the club leadership as a whole. This ensures that all club leads and club lead PMs generally know where projects are in terms of the timeline, and also allows faster detection of any problems that may occur in a project team. This task is extremely important as it directly involves the club and project team’s success.

Some updates that should be obtained periodically regarding each team are:
- Their current progress (which phase of the project are they on?)
- Do the project team want more members?
- Are there any problems or needs within the project team that Co-chairs need to step in and help resolve, or provide advice to the club lead PM?
- Is the project team continuing development, in the event that they either (1) Become inactive or (2) Completed their showcase presentation?

This set of questions is not comprehensive; more information should be obtained if necessary to ensure that each team is well-functioning and on a path to success.
