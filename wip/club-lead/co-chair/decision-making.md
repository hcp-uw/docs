# Decision Making

## Scope Of Decision Making

### Overview
The Co-Chair is responsible for approving what the club decisions are and the primary tasks that need to be done, but not necessarily how those tasks/decisions will be accomplished. But despite having this capability, Co-Chairs should always make the effort to consult club leadership before making any decisions concerning the club. When consulting club leads, Co-Chairs should aim to create a safe and healthy space for discourse among club leadership, where each lead can express their approval or disapproval of club decisions.

When considering any club decision that needs to be made, ensure that the following conditions are met as a result of making the decision:

- Ensures transparency of the decision to all affected members
- Sets positive precedent to the future of the club that is in line with club mission, vision, values and ethical conduct
- Prioritizes the health and well-being of all affected members to avoid overwork or imbalanced work/school/club life balance

### Tasks/Decisions Related to Other Club Leadership
When a Co-Chair determines that a task involving club leadership needs to be accomplished, they must consult the corresponding leadership team related to the task for approval. Once it is democratically approved, the task becomes the responsibility of the corresponding leadership team that the task falls under. Going forward, the Co-Chairs are able to help out and provide advice/feedback on how the task should be accomplished, but the Co-Chair cannot make decisions on behalf of the leadership team working on the task, unless requested to be a neutral tie-breaker. On the other hand, if club leads ask Co-chairs for help regarding a club decision or task, Co-chairs will approve or disapprove it based on what the club’s priorities are at the present time. It is encouraged to confirm such decisions with fellow leads if possible.

### Tasks/Decisions Related to Whole Club
On the other hand, if the Co-Chair wants to make a decision that involves the whole club, they must get a democratic majority approval from all of club leadership before implementing the decision. There should be safe space for debate and rebuttals in order to prioritize the health of the club. If this decision directly impacts club members, then Co-chairs must aim to get feedback from the club about how they would feel about the decision. Then, the Co-Chair must take that feedback into consideration and consult club leadership before deciding whether to make the amended decision. If the decision goes through, it becomes the responsibility of whichever leadership team it relates to to carry out the decision.

### Decisions that Co-Chairs Do *NOT* Make
As previously mentioned, Co-Chairs are allowed to encourage leadership/project teams to meet, to complete tasks by proposed deadlines, and provide support & feedback. However, Co-chairs cannot make final decisions that affect how leadership teams or HCP project teams operate unless it violates previously made decisions and policies that pertain to them. This includes deciding how often they meet, how they solve given problems, or influencing their team dynamics in a way that they did not approve of. If the Co-chair is uncertain about whether a decision falls outside their scope, they should consult their fellow Co-Chair and get their thoughts on the matter. Avoid solo decision making.


## Examples of Decision-Making
*Note: In all examples, "you" refers to the Co-Chair of HCP.*

**Example 1:** You’re trying to plan out the Winter quarter schedule and what events will happen each week, and you believe Week 2 is a great week for an education workshop. Meet with your fellow Co-Chair, confirm the idea with them, then contact the Education Team about your idea and whether they agree. If the Education team approves, it would be fine to include the education workshop in the quarter schedule. Leave it to the Education Team to figure out the workshop details, the contents of the workshop, and how it will be run. They should periodically communicate with you regarding the status of workshop prep, key details associated with it, and any changes or problems that arise from it. If the Education team does NOT approve, then it would not be okay to put it into the schedule.

**Example 2:** You believe that the way we currently operate our project teams, Approach A, is nonsense, and that we should go with Approach B. The club leads the connect most with projects teams are the Onboarding Team + Club Lead PMs. Set up a meeting with them and hear their thoughts on your idea. Let’s say they all say that you’re wrong and Approach A is still better, but they fail to convince you. Start talking to project teams or send out a survey to see what they think about Approach B. Get their thoughts and feedback and relay it back to club leadership on whether their feedback is in favor or against Approach B, and make a decision democratically as a team on which Approach to do.

**Example 3:** The finance team is currently figuring out how to write their sponsorship prospective and are compiling a list of companies to request sponsorship from. Let’s say they want to start Companies A and B before asking C. You as Co-Chair might think it’s a really good idea to start with C first. Pitch the idea to them, but if the majority of them disagree with you, then go with their decision. As Co-Chair, do NOT EVER alter a decision made by the majority to lean in favor of your own idea.
