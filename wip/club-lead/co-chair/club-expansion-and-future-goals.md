# Club Expansion and Future Goals

## Developing Club Leadership
Co-Chairs should promote the growth and development of our club leads so that they become comfortable with their role and capable of training the next generation of club leads. Here’s some ways to do so:

- During 1:1s, inquire club leads about what they might be interested in taking on for the club, and show support on ideas that align with club goals.
- When leadership teams have no tasks, ask the team to come up with things they can work on to strengthen the club
- Provide a supportive environment for club leads to use their creativity to build upon existing ideas/processes.

Developing and supporting our club leadership is what allows club leads to be more autonomous, build confidence in their work, and gain the necessary leadership skills they need to succeed in HCP.

Along with that, Co-Chairs should aspire to build a more diverse club leadership team. Keep in mind, this does NOT mean we gate-keep our leadership team from any identities. Instead, as club leadership, we should encourage club members from diverse backgrounds that stand out amongst their peers to apply to be a club lead. When building diversity, do NOT try and make it a numbers game of what percent of leadership is a certain identity. Instead, it should be a more natural approach with the purpose of building leadership DEI and club culture, rather than trying to meet a quota.

## Future Prospects of HCP
Co-chairs should always strive to take HCP to the next level. This means that Co-Chairs should have a vision for where the club will be in the future and a general list of endeavors to undertake.

**For example**, as of November 2022, these are our potential future prospects that we’re planning to accomplish in the long-term:

- HCP Hack-a-thon in Spring quarter
- Build connections and partnerships with companies to build our attendance to the HCP showcase and supporting our members
- Establishing a mentorship program where developers from companies can mentor our project teams.
- Getting corporate sponsorship for larger events in the future
- Accumulate internship opportunities directly given to use from companies and advertise that to our club members
- Stronger social media presence in order to validate the legitimacy of HCP

Prospects can change year-over-year, but Co-chairs should at least have a couple long-term ideas to work on. This is how the club improves in the long-term.
