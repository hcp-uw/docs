# Purpose & Role Qualifications!

## Purpose of Co-Chair

The purpose of an HCP Co-Chair is to drive the various endeavors that HCP takes on through its members and its leadership, including workshops, social events, project showcases, and other future programs. They serve as a source of enthusiasm and positivity that encourages the growth and development of our members. Additionally, they seek to maintain our club's mission, vision, and values while preserving club growth. Finally, the Co-Chair serves as a leader that’s able to look at the big picture and set up the club for success over the years to come.

## Role Qualifications

### Availability
Co-chairs are required to be available/attend every general meeting for the entire duration, with exceptions to extenuating circumstances (sick, emergency, etc). Outside of general meetings, Co-chairs should have the time flexibility to schedule meetings with other club leads and project teams when necessary.

### Time Commitment
Time commitment of Co-Chairs is approximately ~6-8 hours per week. The breakdown of time usage per week is as follows:
- General Meeting (1.5h+)
- General Meeting Logistics (0.5-1h)
- 1:1s with other club-leads (0.5-1h)
- Co-chair only meetings (1h)
- Meeting with Club Adviser Kasey (0.5h)
- Working on Co-Chair tasks (1h-3h)
- Project PM + Involvement in Club-Wide Tasks (3h).

Time commitment varies throughout the quarter, but this is just a sample average breakdown of weekly time commitment.

## Leading the Club
Co-chairs should be able to demonstrate an ability for effective public speaking. This is expected since club leadership meetings, advisor meetings, and general meetings are largely facilitated by Co-chairs. This includes presenting during general meetings, facilitating constructive discussion amongst club leads, and meeting with advisors to get feedback on club processes and club direction. Co-chairs should be flexible and be able to divide their attention among the various efforts and processes that occur across the club. Co-chair should be able to confidently determine and delegate club tasks to fellow club leads and serve as a driving force of motivation for all things related to HCP.

## Having a Future Vision for HCP to Succeed and Grow
Co-chairs, on the bottom line, are responsible for the development of the club as a whole. This means that Co-chairs need to have a forward-facing vision in terms of the club’s needs and wants, and plan accordingly. Every decision should be made with the club’s future in mind, including decisions to create new teams, partner with other organizations, etc.
