# Professional Outreach

## Communicating with Club Advisor and SAO advisor
A lot of decision-making that goes through the club, especially high-level, should be discussed first with the Club Advisor. Co-chairs should make adequate contact (typically once a week during the academic year, and once every two weeks during the summer) with the club advisor regarding various club-wide updates, upcoming plans, and event planning. This is important for the healthy growth of the club as the Club Advisor offers professional-grade/industry-level insight into some of the club’s workings, and advises us in areas where we lack the knowledge or perspective. As club-leads are the resources for project teams, the Club Advisor is the resource for club-leads. Therefore, it is required for the Co-chairs to maintain a professional and healthy relationship with the Club Advisor.

Beyond the club advisor, we also have a SAO advisor, which is the advisor for the HCP RSO underneath the UW RSO directory. Co-chairs are responsible for maintaining HCP’s active status under the University of Washington Guidelines. Any questions regarding maintaining the club’s status (and existence), as well as logistics for events, needs to be talked about with the SAO Advisor. Therefore, Co-chairs are required and expected to communicate professionally with the SAO Advisor as needed.

## UW staff
University of Washington Staff, most notably professors, are a great resource for HCP especially for broader professional perspectives, their reputation in the community and industry, and their ability to endorse University of Washington RSOs. Co-chairs should maintain positive professional contacts with various University of Washington Staff, so that the club can better its reputation and reach farther in terms of professional contact.

UW Staff may be contacted for a myriad of reasons, including reserving rooms/meeting space within the university, inviting them to the showcase, having them as an advisor for the club, getting/developing some of their project requests, and (futuristic) even professor mentorship. It’s important to maintain good standing amongst staff in order to be able to contact them for these reasons.

## Industry Professionals and Companies
While it’s not always the Co-chair’s responsibility to be messaging industry professionals and/or companies for various reasons, it is a Co-chair responsibility to maintain contact with those that have agreed to work with us. This includes pitching the club, sharing information (e.g. club projects, completed projects, club website, etc.), and obtaining information from our contacts when necessary.
