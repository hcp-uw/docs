# Part 8: Development Phase

[Here’s our workflow guide on how to properly contribute code to your project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1btVnWgRxSAkxIVuYo163bBblR6N7Ye9kqT4P00aMknI/edit?usp=sharing)

[Here’s our guide on how to document your codebase](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jA62Cxp_V5KHXRzae4IoaY4T2LwmcGwlPy-FB1Rbng/edit?usp=sharing)

Again, if you spot mistakes or believe improvements can be made, please notify your club lead guide! We are humans as well, so we are more than happy to support that.

**And that’s it!** It’s time for you and your team to get to work! We encourage the following things from your team to ensure productivity:

- Make the effort to meet at least 1-2 times per week as a whole team.
- Each member should strive to take on tasks and work on it with another member in a pair-programming approach.
- Your PM (not club lead guide) should stay in sync with everyone’s tasks so that if members have questions, the PM can connect your members together.
- Set milestone every 2-3 weeks that your team should try and accomplish
