# Part 6: Github Development Setup
Now that you’ve fleshed out the design of your project, it’s time to set up your GitHub repository so you can begin coding.

1. **Send a message containing the following in the Tech Team channel and ping the Tech Team role in your message.**
    - The name of your project
    - A list of GitHub usernames for every member of the team
    - The GitHub username of your project manager/leader

2. **The Tech Team will create both a public GitHub repository and a GitHub Team for your project. The repository will have the following branch protection on the main branch.**
    - No commit can be made to the **main** branch directly
    - All merges into the **main branch** require a pull request with at least one approving review
    - A new approving review is required if a new commit is made to the pull request branch

3. **Once the Tech Team creates the GitHub repository and team, push your first commit to start up your main codebase**
    - Clone your project’s repository (Insert instructions on how to do this)
    - Create a new branch
    - Make changes to the new branch and commit them
    - Push your commit to the repository on GitHub
    - Create a pull request that merges changes from your branch to the main branch
    - Have at least 1 team member leave an approving review of your pull request
    - Click the merge button at the bottom of the pull request
4. **Just keep coding and don’t hesitate to reach out to the Tech Team with any questions or if you need some guidance with Git.**
