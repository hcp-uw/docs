# Part 3: Informal Pitch to Club Leadership

### Why create an informal pitch?
Preparing for an informal pitch allows the team to gather their thoughts together and be able to start building up the foundations of their project plan. It will also allow the team to agree on what the project may turn out to be in unison rather than by oneself. This is an **informal and private pitch** to your club lead guide, so feel free to have a bit of fun! Keep it around 5-7 minutes tops, and please answer the following questions using the Pitch template below:

[The Pitch Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c7TFfePsd5rGWdF25vzxAV8bnQp77xtv4BxDcwRIPi0/edit?usp=sharing)

### Include the following in your pitch:
- What is your product? Explain what you think your MVP (minimum viable product) is, what are the minimal features and requirements you want to achieve?
- Is your product viable? Show some high-level information to prove it.
- What are some of the main high-level features that your product will have?
(optional) Creating visuals and mockups is **strongly recommended** to allow the team to agree on the most important aspects and provide leads with more context about your project. One example could be creating a [Figma](http://figma.com/), a website/application interface builder.
- What are the projected platform/stack/languages that your product can potentially be developed on?
- Please decide what project role each of your team members will take on. Highlight them in your pitch! For info on HCP project roles, see here: [Project Team Roles](https://hcp-uw.github.io/docs/project-team/resources/project-team-roles)
- Keep it organized and quick but there is room for error since it is an “informal” pitch.

### Examples!

The following are links to some great examples of pitches. Feel free to use their structure as a place to start, but try to make it your own!

**Here’s some notes on how to maximize the benefits of pitching:**
- Take notes on what club leads suggest after your team pitch! Their feedback can be very useful because they’ve had experience with HCP projects before.
- If your team is indecisive at any of the questions above, they can revisit any of the previous Parts to edit or even fully change their project idea.
- After feedback is given, review the notes from the meeting and update your project based on the suggestions.
