# Introduction

## About

The following documentation has been assembled and put together by HCP leadership in order to support our members in the design and development process of their team programming project from start to finish. The goal is to follow the industry timeline of designing a project but modified to be more light-weight to support the student lifestyle. This will be an evolving documentation that will be improved over time to continue providing members with relevant resources, but please refer to these docs if you have questions about your project timeline.

## General Timeline

The average student's programming project tends to be disorganized and involves them just jumping into the code and constructing some type of product that might be functional but not designed well. In the industry, it is incredibly important to brainstorm, design, and specify every single feature of the product that you're developing, and that is what separates our development process from the average personal project.

The following documentation will contain information on:

- Project Team Guidelines and General Timeline
- Project Team Roles
- Product Spec Template and Presentation Guidelines
- Writing Codebase Documentation
- Project Management Through Github
- Other Programming Resources

**If you notice any mistakes or you believe there's some resources that HCP leadership should provide that's missing here or you believe this can be improved, contact us! We want to hear from you how we can do better.**
