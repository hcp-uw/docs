# Product Spec Template

## Why Do We Need This?

There are two reasons why we require new projects to create a specification. First, to ensure that every project member has the same vision for the project. Second, it motivates project teams to create a plan about how to tackle the project without the complication of the actual code. **Describe the “what” of the project, not the “how”!**

<u>Note</u>: Here’s the **[Google Doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/169_JjLg3zMQTc8B1JKHPR8_eggTdrnz-hwBvqkTHm00/edit?usp=sharing)** if you want it

## Product Specification Requirements

- [ ] **A high-level summary** of the product you are building, keep it concise
- [ ] **The problem** (can be a problem that has already been solved) that your product is solving
  - [ ] What is the problem?
  - [ ] Why do we have this problem?
  - [ ] How can we help?
  - [ ] Who will benefit? Who are your product’s intended users?
- [ ] **Team Breakdown**
  - [ ] Who is the project manager or point of contact?
  - [ ] How will the team be divided by role (for ex. front-end/back-end/design)?
  - [ ] Who will be on each subteam/subgroup?
- [ ] Your **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)**
  - [ ] List features that your product should have. Be specific!
    - [ ] What are the main deliverables of your product you want to accomplish first at minimum? **(MVP deliverables, high priority)**
    - [ ] What are some deliverables you hope to accomplish after your MVP? **(Post-MVP deliverables, lower priority)**
    - [ ] Describe these features in detail on how they will behave, how you expect them to be used.
  - [ ] **Design** (Technical and Non-Technical)
    - [ ] What is the high-level architecture of your product? Provide a diagram of your tech stack and how they connect.
    - [ ] If your product has a **front-end user interface**:
      - [ ] Use Figma or any wireframing tool to visualize your product. Include a publicly viewable link to your wireframe.
      - [ ] View of product (Refer to the wireframe)
        - [ ] How does each page or view of the product look?
        - [ ] How does the user navigate between views?
      - [ ] For each feature’s user journey,
        - [ ] What is the user journey like for each feature?
        - [ ] How does the product look when activating the feature? During usage? After usage?
    - [ ] If your product will require a **back-end** to provide services to the front-end:
      - [ ] What will the front-end be requesting from the backend?
      - [ ] Will it need to interact with a database?
    - [ ] If your product requires a **database** for information storage:
      - [ ] What type of database is it? Relational database? NoSQL?
      - [ ] What is your database schema/structure? How would you interact with it?
    - [ ] **If your product requires other services**, how will they connect to your product and provide support for its’ features?
    - [ ] **REGARDLESS of your stack**, how do you plan to test your code at each level of the stack? What potential testing frameworks/suites can your team use to show that each feature is functional and bug-free?
    - [ ] **(If applicable) REGARDLESS of your stack**, how will your team prioritizing privacy, security, and accessibility in your project?
- [ ] **General timeline**
  - [ ] High-level timeline of the development process
  - [ ] When do you anticipate finishing your product? Each section of features?
  - [ ] Take into account how long your learning phase will be, because that takes up a significant portion of time.
