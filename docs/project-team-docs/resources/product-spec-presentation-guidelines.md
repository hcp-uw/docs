# Product Spec Presentation Guidelines

## Purpose

The purpose of presenting your product specification is so that your team has a chance to show off the work you’ve done so far and get feedback from the audience on what your team can do to improve your product design. It also serves as a deadline to finish your specification by, and also as quality assurance since the highlights of your product spec will be viewed by everyone. It’s also a great chance for inter-team collaboration and teams can provide verbal support, feedback, and suggestions on how to improve.

## Presentation Format
**You do not need to make a presentation slideshow! Although you can if you want to. At the very least, you need to use your Spec Doc and Figma as visuals.**

Every spec presentation (not spec) needs to meet the following:

- Duration: 5-7 minutes
- Verbalize the following while showing your spec:
  - A concise and strong overview of the product
  - Explain what your project is trying to achieve and/or solve.
  - State the minimum viable product features of your project
  - Demonstrate how your MVP features will look and behave with a Figma prototype or design mockup, briefly walk us through it!
  - Explain how these features will be developed. Including information on your tech stack and how each part of the stack will support these features
  - Show questions that the teams still need to answer or figure out


## How to Get the Most Out of Presentations

We want you to succeed and get the most out of Spec Presentation Day! Here’s some tried and tested ways to get the most out of this:

- **Revise spec & prototype with club lead guide prior to presenting!** Especially well in advance of the presentation day. They can point you in the right direction on parts that need improvement and help strengthen your spec.
- **Pay attention to other projects and take notes!** Other projects will be using various tech stacks or frameworks that maybe your project could make use of as well. They might have figured out some things that your team forgot to think about. Be sure to note down some of these decisions or questions your team needs to answer in the future. Help each other out!
- **Seek feedback from the audience!** You and your team should strive to get suggestions and feedback from your audience because there is always something that your team might’ve missed that someone in the audience would’ve caught. Encourage your audience to ask questions or provide constructive criticism and be open-minded to all feedback!
- **Reveal what questions your team still needs to answer!** We include the part about including questions that the teams still need to figure out so that teams can support and help each other out! When teams have questions they need to answer and you have a potential solution, help them out! Note down any suggestions that the audience gives you for the questions your team still needs to answer as well. Help others, and others will help you!
- **Regroup after presentations to go over feedback!** Use the time after everyone presents to talk amongst your team about what specific things still need to be worked on or figured out. Write it down where everyone can see and try to delegate some of the tasks that need to be worked on. If some involve working on them together as a whole team, then plan for that!
