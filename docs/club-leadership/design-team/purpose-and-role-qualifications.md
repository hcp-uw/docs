# Purpose & Role Qualifications

## Purpose of Design Lead
The purpose of an HCP Design lead is to provide design-related expertise that teams can rely on when working on their projects. Design leads will be a source of knowledge and a second set of eyes for teams to consult with for design-related feedback. Design leads will also collaborate with the Education team to develop workshops for project teams and other interested students.

## Role Qualifications

### Hard Skills
It is required for Design leads to have a basic understanding of UX/UI design including wireframing, prototyping, typography, color theory, and interaction design. This team may have requests to support other club lead team responsibilities, such as designs for marketing events and revamping the club website. Design leads must also have at least one example of a project created using Figma or a similar design software.

### Soft Skills
Design team leads should be willing to learn about unfamiliar topics to provide well-rounded feedback to project teams. Additionally, Design leads need to maintain clear communication within the team, brainstorm and contribute ideas for future workshops, and be able to communicate design concepts efficiently.

### Availability
Design leads should be available/attend most general meetings for the entire duration, with exceptions for extenuating circumstances (sick, emergency, etc). Outside of general meetings, Design leads should have the time flexibility to meet outside of general meetings and to respond to teams who need advice.

### Time Commitment
Time commitment of Design leads is approximately ~3 hours per week. The breakdown of time usage per week is as follows:

- [1.5+ hrs] General Meeting (Synchronous Advising)
- [1 hr] Design Team Meeting
- [15 mins] Check ins with Co-Chairs
- [1 hr] Design Lead specific asynchronous tasks (workshop making, club design work (stickers, website, etc.), design critiques)

Time commitment varies throughout the quarter, but this is just a sample average breakdown of weekly time commitment.

Note that design team responsibilities are front-loaded in the school year. Expect more frequency in team consulting and design workshops in the Fall and Winter quarters.
