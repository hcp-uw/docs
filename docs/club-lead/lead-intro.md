# Introduction

## About

The following documentation discusses the roles of responsibilities of every lead team within the HCP leadership team. Every role in our leadership team must be documented and kept up-to-date in order to maintain accountability of each club lead's responsibilities and scope of decision-making.

## Our Leadership Teams

### Hierarchy

Our leadership hierarchy is extremely flat, which is intentional to maintain democracy and ensures that no team has power over the other and that every club lead's opinion is equally respected. However, every lead team is responsible for their own domain of work and do not need to consult other lead teams when doing club work unless it encroaches on their responsibilities.

Above all lead teams are the Co-Chair role, which is a 2 person team that is responsible for leading the club and the leadership teams.
