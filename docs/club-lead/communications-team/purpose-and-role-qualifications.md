# Purpose & Role Qualifications

## Purpose of Communication Lead

The purpose of an HCP Communications lead is primarily to outreach and prompt collaboration with other clubs/organizations and build connections between industry professionals/the club. Communication leads keep members up-to-date on events, workshops, and reminders related to the club through HCPâ€™s social media platforms.

## Role Qualifications

### Hard Skills
It is required that communication leads know how to utilize Canva templates or other design applications. Exceptional design skill is not required, as leads will likely use similar post templates from previous years, or use the premade designs given through the platform. Listed below are required tasks:

- Type professional emails for club/organization outreach
- Draft social media caption input
- Update LinkTree with relevant information in a timely manner (i.e. two weeks or a week before an upcoming event)


### Soft Skills
Communicate about scheduling posting dates/times with other communication leads. A lot of the content in social media should be looked over by other communication leads before being released to the public. Creativity in design and captions for social media are preferred.

## Availability
Communication leads should be available/attend every general meeting for the entire duration, with exceptions for extenuating circumstances (sick, emergency, etc). Outside of general meetings, Communication leads should have the time flexibility to work on busier event posting weeks.
