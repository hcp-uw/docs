# Discord Management

## When to create channels
Channels should be created only when necessary. Co-chairs are required to create any necessary channels in general/club-lead categories of the discord server, and ensure that permissions for each channel and category are set correctly. Co-chairs should not be creating channels for individual teams; that is up to the Club lead PM to do so based on their teamâ€™s needs. If a channel needs to be created, Co-chairs should check in the archived section and revive a channel as necessary, if it fits the needs of the creation request.

## When to delete channels
Inactive general channels may be deleted when the last message sent in the channel was over 5 months old. This ensures that unused channels in the Discord get deleted to avoid clutter. In no other scenario should a channel be deleted ever in the discord, it is better to keep logs on the previous work and codnversation that has been done within the club.

## When to archive channels
Inactive channels pertaining to club leads, club information, or project teams should never be deleted, and instead archived at the bottom of the discord. This allows us to maintain a record of chat logs of each channel, and for an archived channel to be revived as needed.
