# Managing Leadership Teams

## One-on-Ones
It is the Co-Chair’s responsibility to facilitate 15 minute 1:1 conversations with each club lead every week. Each Co-Chair will take half of the leadership team to do 1:1s with.

Please refer to the following guide on how 1:1s work: **[Club Lead 1:1 Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvjFDgu-AMqXRtZZTSfowxk9pEFwF_U5GvkIqB_w_QA/edit#)**

## Meeting with Club Lead Teams
Depending on whatever tasks are currently in-progress, meet with whoever is responsible for those tasks and ensure they are making sufficient progress. This may happen through your 1:1s or through separate meetings. Work with your fellow Co-Chair to decide who follows up on what tasks.

For every task that you follow up with, ensure that the club leads working on it have the following things figured out:
- Deliverables for the task
- A plan for how to accomplish it with action items/milestones listed out
- A tentative date for when the task should be done by

Revisit these things with the people working on the task periodically to make sure they are on track.

## Delegating Tasks to Club Leadership
Co-Chairs should avoid taking on all of the tasks themselves just for the sake of getting it done sooner than later. Co-chairs should aim to delegate tasks to their club leads, especially if it falls under a specific leadership team. Make sure the lead team that the task is being delegated to agrees to take on the task. Sharing the weight of tasks allows Co-chairs to maintain a healthy club/school/social lifestyle. That being said, Co-chairs should avoid delegating Co-Chair-only tasks to regular club leads unless there are extenuating circumstances.


## Recruiting Club Leads
Towards the end of spring quarter every year, we will start recruiting for club leads
for the following school year. Before starting this process, please check in with club lead teams to see if they need more members on their team and keep that in mind when recruiting new club leads. Regardless of that, we try to stay receptive to what new potential leads want to work on and guide them towards those interests. But as always, we will try to encourage club leads to work on tasks that are most beneficial to the club as a whole and fall under their category of work.

There's is a doc regarding how recruiting should work, but it tends to change a bit
each year. Scroll to the bottom of this **[doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vARQ_6Rj4cn-oFg9_JVskAWCNT-URkp_e6jC6W__nyo/edit#)** to see what was initially brainstormed
for the recruiting time of 2023.

After recruiting, the summer after the school year ends is the time for yourself
and the returning leadership team to support and train the new incoming leads. We
recommend assigning each new lead to a returning lead and encourage a buddy system.
Remember to encourage a welcome environment that is okay with mistakes. It's the
summer, so it's the perfect time for new leads to make mistakes, learn, and get their
hands dirty with documentation work, event prep work, or even showcase prep work!


## Quarterly Retrospectives
At the end of every quarter, it is the Co-Chair’s responsibility to set up a retrospective to reflect on what went well, what could’ve gone better, and how we can do better. Get everyone’s availability and pick a 1 hour time block to meet with club leadership and facilitate the retrospective. Co-Chairs should work towards hearing everyone’s thoughts, ensuring everyone gets a chance to speak for each section, and also provide a space for final thoughts that people can input on their own time. Have everything written down on a document that everyone has access to and can reference during the next quarter’s retrospective.
