# Workshop Planning Timeline

## 1.) Workshop Idea Selection/Generation
The Education team should plan workshops at least 1-2 months prior to the presentation date to ensure workshop quality. Workshop dates must also be decided before the start of each quarter so that they can be included in the quarterly schedule.

There are multiple ways to choose the topic for a workshop. Previously used strategies include polling the club with a google form, tailoring the topic to the quarter (ex: interview prep during fall quarter) or choosing a topic from the existing Workshop Idea Lists. It is also important for Education Leads to check with Club Lead Project Managers and Tech Leads to discover topics that many club members are curious about.

**At this point, please communicate with the communications team on the possibility of these workshops happening and when. More info on step 5.**

## 2.) Topic Research
For the weeks leading up to a workshop, the education lead should prepare by researching on the topic of the workshop with the main focus on the more specific topic that they are designated to. By the time of the presentation date, the lead should have a strong understanding of the topic that they are presenting and also understand other parts of the workshop well enough that they are able to answer questions. While doing research on topics, make sure not to rely too much on a single source to prevent bias.

## 3.) Presentation Creation/Quality
The slide deck should consist of the following: Introduction to the topic/people presenting, overview of the workshop, teaching content (this is the bulk of the presentation, whether it consists of lecturing for 30 mins straight, initiating collaborative activities, or presenting a question to solve), and thanking everyone/closing/excusing everyone at the end of the workshop. You will know if the presentation is upheld to quality through dry runs, and whether the pacing makes sense for the given time of the workshop.

Quality should be upheld in reference to past workshops. See **[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sh4WHWyFSS965sE8zsfuzhTulAI5uBAeZV2Fv1w6xjk/edit#heading=h.pf8x5wod49bo)** for links to past workshop slides.


## 4.) Room Reservation
When planning for the workshop, Education Leads must ensure that there is a room available to host the workshop on their desired data/time. This should be known prior to the start of the quarter in which the workshop is occurring. (Collaborate with the Co-chairs here) A byproduct of the room selection process is that an education lead must ensure that their workshop is able to be presented within that room. This means ensuring that the number of projectors, number of chairs, etc are conducive to the workshop and vice versa: ensuring that the workshop is tailored for the specific room. For example, if there is only 1 projector and the workshop requires the club to be split into 3 groups, presenting Google Slides may not be the best solution.

## 5.) Advertise Workshop w/ Communication Team
Communications team has a spreadsheet with all of the postings and designs planned each quarter, so it is crucial for their preparation to reach out to the communications team at the beginning of the year, or at least after the end of each quarter or earlier.

Doing so will allow them to plan accordingly when creating ad designs. Education Leads just have to give them logistical details and say “This workshop may happen then, please plan to include a posting date accordingly”.

Make sure to give them key info: workshop topic, mission/purpose for people to attend, date/time, location, any prerequisites. IF the date/time of the workshop cannot be confirmed in the earlier stages, make sure to notify them later as described below.

**Closer to the date of the workshop, after gathering room reservation and date/time of the workshop**, confirm the communication team has all the correct workshop information. Do so by using the communication lead channel.

## 6.) Collaboration with RSOs/Other Educ Organizations
Use the official HCP gmail (huskycodingproject@gmail.com) for all messages between RSOs. If the RSO plans to have a discord channel or different means of communicating, make sure the whole HCP education team, or more than one member of the team is added. Make sure the following is confirmed with the other RSO:

- Who is responsible for room reservations?
- When do we have to host the workshop? Avoid hosting during HCP general meeting dates
- Can they provide us with an email list of potential attendees?
- What are our expected responsibilities, for how much we need to teach or cover?
- Who will handle marketing, in terms of social media post designs and ensuring we have a sufficient amount of outreach? Them or us (communicate with the communications team if it's the latter!!)?

## 7.) Dry-Run(s)
Prior to the workshop, Education Leads are required to attend and be fully prepared at a Dry-Run where the entire team will run through the workshop and advise one another on areas to improve. Note that this dry run is mandatory for presenters and recommended for non-presenters. Also, multiple dry runs might be necessary if the previous ones are determined to be underprepared by the education team, co-chair or other team lead.

## 8.) Presenting the Workshop
Education Leads are required to be a presenter in at least one workshop per year. This will allow them to strengthen their communication skills and gain valuable insight to improve educational workshops in the future. In the situations where an Education Lead is not presenting, they should act as a "helper" and walk around to answer any quick questions. Thus, the Lead must ensure that they know the workshop content and some common errors people might run into.

## 9.) Retrospective
After each workshop, education leads are required to attend the retrospective in which they will discuss as a team on what they did well in the workshop and what can be done better for future workshops. This last process is critical because it allows the team to reflect on the experiences and ensures the quality of future workshops.
