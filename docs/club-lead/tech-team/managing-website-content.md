# Managing HCP Website Content [N][R]

*Quick Terminology*
- [N] indicates that a task is "not-shared" means that not every Tech lead must do this task
- [R] indicates that a task is "required" means there must be at least one Tech lead on the task

## What?
Tech leads are in charge of ensuring that the content on the club-wide website stays up to date and relevant.

Tasks in this area include but are not limited to:
- Keeping the list of leads updated to include only those that are active
- Updating and procuring project information including logos, members, PM, project type, blurb, etc.
- Updating the list of events as they are planned and completed. This includes procuring event images created by the communications team.

When adding content to the website, leads should also ensure that it adheres to UW and HCP values. Note that tech leads should NOT modify any of the content directly without the approval of the creators of said content.

The motto for this task is "With great power comes with great responsibility".

## How?

Updating the club website will be done primarily through updating the information in the database directly (unless the website team has built out a GUI for updating data).
