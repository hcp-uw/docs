# Purpose & Role Qualifications

## Purpose of Tech Lead

The purpose of an HCP Tech lead is to provide technological expertise that teams can rely on when working on their projects. Tech leads will be a source of knowledge and experience that all the teams can tap into. Note that it is common for Tech leads to be a part of the Education team due to their expertise in a broad range of subjects.

## Role Qualifications

### Hard Skills
Since tech leads should be able to advise club teams on a broad range of subjects, it is required that tech leads have completed at least one significant software-related project. However, we do NOT expect you to come in with knowledge of everything. Instead, you should be willing and able to quickly learn a new technology if consulted about it.

### Soft Skills
First and foremost, tech leads should be willing to say "I don't know, but I will learn more about it and get back to you" when consulted on an unfamiliar technology. Tech leads are also required to be able to communicate complex ideas in simple terms. Finally, tech leads should be able to assess the following about a resource or piece of information: credibility, density, prerequisites needed to understand.

### Availability
Tech leads should be available/attend every general meeting for the entire duration, with exceptions for extenuating circumstances (sick, emergency, etc). Outside of general meetings, Tech leads should have the time flexibility to work on the club website and respond to teams that need advice.

### Time Commitment
Time commitment of Tech leads is approximately ~3 hours per week. The breakdown of time usage per week is as follows:
- [1.5h+] General Meeting (Sync Advising)
- [0.5h+] Async Advising
- [1.5h] Tech Lead Specific Tasks, such as:
    - Managing HCP Github, Google Drive, Discord, Cloud Technologies, Website Content, etc.
Time commitment varies throughout the quarter, but this is just a sample average breakdown of weekly time commitment.
