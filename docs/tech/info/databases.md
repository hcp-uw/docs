# Databases

This is a collection of resources for learning about databases.

## Introduction

A database is a collection of data that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used in a wide variety of applications, and are crucial to persisting data in web applications.

## Database Management Systems

A database management system (DBMS) is a software system that allows users to define, create, and maintain a database. It provides an interface for users to interact with the database, and allows users to perform operations such as querying, updating, and deleting data.

### Relational Databases

A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables. Each table consists of rows and columns, and each row represents a single record. Each column represents a single attribute of the record.

Relational databases are the most common type of database, and are used in a wide variety of applications. They are typically used for storing structured data, such as user information, product information, and financial records.

#### MySQL

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on SQL. It is one of the most popular databases in the world, and is used by many large companies, including Facebook, Google, and Twitter.

#### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on SQL. It is another one of the most popular databases in the world, and is used by many large companies, including Apple, Netflix, and Spotify.

#### Supabase

Supabase is a feature rich open source Firebase alternative. It is a hosted database that provides a variety of features, including authentication, authorization, and real-time updates. It is built on top of PostgreSQL, and is designed to be easy to use and integrate with existing applications. It also has a free tier that includes a fully managed Postgres instance, making it a great choice for small projects.

#### SQLite

SQLite is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on SQL. It is one of the most widely deployed databases in the world, and is comparatively lightweight and easy to use, making it a popular choice for embedded systems, mobile applications, and beginner developers.


### Non-Relational Databases

A non-relational database is a type of database that does not store data in tables. Instead, it stores data in a variety of different formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, and graphs.

Non-relational databases are typically used for storing unstructured data, such as text, images, and videos. They are also used for storing data that is not easily represented in a relational database.

#### MongoDB

MongoDB is an open-source document database based on JSON. It is one of the most popular non-relational databases, and is a great choice for storing unstructured data, such as text, images, and videos.

#### Redis

Redis is an open-source key-value store. It is one of the most popular non-relational databases, and is a great tool for caching data, storing session data, and implementing queues because of its speed and simplicity.

#### Firebase

Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) that provides developers with a variety of tools and service. It is a great choice for small projects because it is easy to use and has a generous free tier. It has a simple API, and provides a variety of features, including query-able JSON storage, blob storage, authentication, and real-time updates.

#### DynamoDB

DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and extremely scalable storage. It is a great choice for applications that require high performance and low latency, but often requires a lot of upfront schema design to ensure your use case is supported. Although it is primarily a key-value store, there are a variety of data types that can be stored in DynamoDB, including strings, numbers, lists, and maps.
